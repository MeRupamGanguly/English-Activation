## Auxiliary Verbs:
Avi jo Verbs ke type hai use hame yaad rakhna hai, inke madat se ham jab Tense parenge tab sentences ko form karna sikhenge.

Auxilary verbs jaise ki `Be Verb`(am, is, are, was, were, being, been), `Have verb`(have, has, had), `Do verb`(do, does, did) and `Modal verb`(can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would) ea sab sentence pai use hota hai Main verb ke sath, taki Sentense ke Tense and Sentence kis Tone and kis Mood pai bola gya hai ow Jata sake.

Jab sentence Present Tense pai hai and Subject pai `I`, `You`, `We`, `They` ho to `DO` ka use kia jata hai. 

Jab sentence Present Tense pai hai and Subject pai `He`, `She`, `It`, Nouns(`Name`) ho to DOES ka use kia jata hai.

Jab sentence pai `He`, `She`, `It` aise singular noun use hota hai tab `Has` ka use hota hai. `Anyone`, `Somebody`, `Nobody` aise Singular form ke sath vi `Has` hi use hota hai.

Jab sentence pai `They`, `We`, `You` aise Plural Nouns ka use hota hai tab `Have` hota hai. Sentence pai jab `I` jo ki First Person Singular hai, usha use hota hai tab vi `Have` ka hi use hota hai. `Few`, `Several`, `Many` aise plural form ke sath vi `Have` hi use hota hai. 

## Use of s/es:
- Jab Senetence Simple Present Tense pai ho and Subject pai `He`, `She`, `It` and `Name` ho to `s`/`es` ka add hota hai verb ke end pai. Baki kisi vi case pai `s`/`es` add nhi hota hai like, agar Senetence Past or Future ka ho tab `s`/`es` add nhi hoga.Jab Simple Present Tense pai Sentence ho But Senetence pai Modal verbs like `Can`, `Could`, `May`, `Might`, `Shall`, `Should`, `Must` ka use kia gya hai tab vi `s`/`es` nhi add hota hai verb ke end pai.
Jab verb `s`.`ss`, `sh`, `o`, `x` se end ho tab `es` add hota hai verb ke end pai. jab verb `Consonant`+`y` se end hota hai tab `y` ko replace karke `ies` ka use hota hai. jab verb ke end pai `vowel`+`y` hota hai tab `s` add hota hai verb ke end pai.

Example:
- I play tennis. `I`
- She plays tennis. `She` `vowel`+`y`
- We play soccer. `We`
- They play soccer. `They`
- She passes the ball. `She` `ss`
- She studies for her exams. `She` `consonant`+`y`

- He can swim. `He` `can`
- They could come tomorrow. `They` `could`

- He played soccer yesterday. `He` `played`
- She will play soccer tomorrow. `She` `will` `play`


## Negetive And Introgative
- Subject + Auxiliary Verb + Not + Verb + Object
- Auxiliary Verb + Subject + Verb + Object + ?

Agar Sentence Simple Present Tense pai hai to Negetive Karne ke liea DO verb ka use karke, DO verb ke bad NOT use karenge. Introgative karna hai to DO verb ko Subject ke age shift kar denge.

Agar Sentence Simple Present Tense pai hai and Modal verb use hua hai to Negetive Karne ke liea MODAL verb ke bad NOT use karenge. Introgative karna hai to Modal verb ko Subject ke age shift kar denge.

Agar Sentence Simple Present Tense pai hai and Be verb use hua hai to Negetive Karne ke liea Be verb ke bad NOT use karenge. Introgative karna hai to Be verb ko Subject ke age shift kar denge.



| STATEMENT     | NEGETIVE     | INTROGATIVE     |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| `Cloud` stores **data**. | Cloud does not store data. | Does cloud store data?|
| `AI` predicts **outcomes**. | AI does not predict outcomes. | Does AI predict outcomes? |
| `Programmers` write **code**. | Programmers do not write code. | Do programmers write code? |

  
When the affirmative statement includes a modal verb (e.g., can, will, should), the transformation into negatives and interrogatives follows different rules.

| STATEMENT     | NEGETIVE     | INTROGATIVE     |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| `He` can speak **French**. | He cannot speak French. | Can he speak French? |

Statements that already use auxiliary verbs (e.g., be verbs - is, am, are; have verbs - has, have) may have different transformations.

| STATEMENT     | NEGETIVE     | INTROGATIVE     |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| `They` are **engineers**. | They are not engineers. | Are they engineers? |

Present simple tense rules may not apply directly to statements in other tenses (e.g., past tense, future tense).

### Conversation 1: Discussing a Bug in the Golang Service

Teammate 1:
Hey, I was going through the logs, and it seems like there’s an issue with the database query in the GetUserDetails function. It's returning an error when we try to fetch the data. Did you notice anything?

Teammate 2:
Yeah, I saw that too. The problem might be related to the query performance. We could optimize the query by adding indexes to the user_id and created_at columns. That should help speed things up. What do you think?

Teammate 1:
Good idea. I'll go ahead and add the indexes to the database schema. Also, I've been thinking of switching to prepared statements for these queries to prevent any SQL injection issues.

Teammate 2:
Definitely! Prepared statements will improve security and help with query execution plans too. We should also add some error handling around the database connection, just in case it times out.

Teammate 1:
Agreed. Let me make those changes, and I’ll push the updates. Once done, we can run some tests to see if the issue is resolved.

Teammate 2:
Sounds good. I’ll review your code after you push it and check if everything looks good. Let me know if you need help with testing.




### Conversation 2: Setting Up a Caching Layer

Teammate 1:
I think we should implement a caching layer for our Golang API to reduce load on the database. What do you think about integrating Redis?

Teammate 2:
I agree! Redis is a great choice for caching. It will drastically reduce response times for frequently accessed data. Do you want to cache the user profile data or something else?

Teammate 1:
I was thinking of caching the user profile details and their recent activity data. These are the most accessed endpoints in the app. We can set a time-to-live (TTL) for the cache to make sure the data doesn't get stale.

Teammate 2:
Sounds like a plan. I'll handle setting up Redis in the Docker containers. We’ll use the Redis Go client for this. We’ll need to create a cache invalidation strategy too, so the cache gets cleared when the user updates their data.

Teammate 1:
Good point! I’ll work on the TTL and cache invalidation. We should use a background job to update the cache periodically as well, just in case we don’t want to rely solely on TTL.

Teammate 2:
I’ll get started with the Redis setup. Let’s keep testing as we go so we can spot any performance bottlenecks.





### Conversation 3: API Versioning Discussion

Teammate 1:
We need to implement API versioning for our Golang service. I was thinking of using path-based versioning (e.g., /v1/user and /v2/user). What do you think?

Teammate 2:
Path-based versioning sounds good. It’s clear and easy to implement. We could also use the Accept header for versioning if we want more flexibility in the future, but for now, path-based should work fine.

Teammate 1:
I agree. I’ll go ahead and start by adding versioning for the user-related endpoints. We should also document these version changes clearly so that consumers of our API are aware of the updates.

Teammate 2:
Absolutely. I’ll update the API documentation once you finish the changes. If we add new fields to the user object, we’ll need to handle backward compatibility as well.

Teammate 1:
Yeah, we’ll need to handle that carefully. I’ll make sure to add new fields with optional defaults, and any breaking changes will be clearly documented in the version release notes.


### Conversation 4: Handling Race Conditions

Teammate 1:
I’m having an issue with a race condition in one of the goroutines. The order of execution is causing inconsistent results. I’ve tried adding locks, but I’m not sure it’s the best solution.

Teammate 2:
Hmm, race conditions can be tricky. If you’re working with shared data, using mutexes might help, but have you considered using channels instead? They could help synchronize the goroutines more effectively.

Teammate 1:
You’re right. Channels could be a better approach. I’ll try using channels for communication between the goroutines and see if that resolves the issue.

Teammate 2:
Make sure to check the Go race detector when testing. It’ll help identify any potential race conditions during runtime.

Teammate 1:
Thanks for the reminder! I’ll run the race detector and refactor the code to use channels. I’ll keep you posted on the progress.


### Conversation 5: Optimizing API Performance

Teammate 1:
I noticed the API is getting a bit slow when there are multiple concurrent requests. I’m thinking of using Goroutines to handle them in parallel. Do you think it’ll help?

Teammate 2:
Goroutines can definitely help with concurrency. But for handling API performance, I’d recommend looking into a proper load balancing mechanism. Also, we should add a rate-limiting feature to prevent excessive requests from overwhelming the system.

Teammate 1:
Good point. We can use a middleware to implement rate limiting. As for load balancing, I was considering using Kubernetes to manage our service deployments. That should give us automatic scaling when needed.

Teammate 2:
Kubernetes is a great choice for that. It will help with scaling and managing resources efficiently. I’ll look into integrating rate-limiting with Redis to track request counts.

Teammate 1:ll foc
Perfect. Let me know if you need help with setting up Kubernetes. I’us on improving the query optimizations for the API calls.


### Conversation 6: Setting Up Unit Tests for Golang

Teammate 1:
I’m starting to work on adding unit tests for our new user registration feature. Do you have any tips on structuring them for the Golang service?

Teammate 2:
Sure! For unit tests, it’s a good idea to mock external dependencies like the database or external APIs. That way, the tests are isolated and won’t depend on actual data. You can use testify for mocks.

Teammate 1:
I was planning on using Golang's built-in testing package. Do you think I should add testify as well?

Teammate 2:
Yeah, I recommend it. It’s really useful for mocking and assertions. Also, make sure you cover edge cases like invalid inputs, database failures, and concurrency issues.

Teammate 1:
Great! I’ll add testify to the project and set up the mocks. I’ll also write tests for common edge cases. Let me know if you want to review them once I’m done.

Teammate 2:
Definitely! I’ll take a look once you push them. It’ll be good to have solid tests in place before we move forward with the feature.


### Conversation 7: Discussing API Error Handling
Teammate 1:
"We need to improve error handling in our API. Whenever there's a 500 error, the user doesn't know what's going wrong."

Teammate 2:
"Yeah, that's a problem. I think we should add specific error codes and messages. For instance, if the database connection fails, we can send a 500 Database Error message."

Teammate 1:
"Exactly. And instead of just throwing generic error messages, we could use structured error responses. That will make it easier for the frontend team to handle errors properly."

Teammate 2:
"Agreed. I'll update the error handling middleware to include this. Do you think we should log the stack trace for debugging purposes?"

Teammate 1:
"Definitely. Logging detailed error information can help with debugging later. But we should make sure not to log sensitive data."

Teammate 2:
"Right, we should mask any personal user data in the logs to avoid security issues."


### Conversation 8: Discussing API Error Handling

```Explanation of English Structures in the Conversation:```

1. Modals: "Should", "Could", "Would"
"We need to improve error handling in our API" – This is a declarative statement expressing a requirement.
"We should add specific error codes and messages" – The modal verb "should" expresses a suggestion or recommendation. In this case, Teammate 2 is suggesting an improvement in error handling.
"Do you think we should log the stack trace?" – Here, "should" is again used to ask for an opinion or advice regarding the next step.
Why we use this structure: Modals like "should" and "could" allow the speaker to make suggestions, give advice, or express possibility. They are helpful when discussing solutions or options.

2. Passive Voice: "Be sent"
"We can send a 500 Database Error message" – This is in active voice. The subject (we) is doing the action (sending the message).
"Error messages can be structured in a way that’s easier to understand." – If we had used passive here, it would focus more on the action being done to the message rather than who’s doing the action.
Why we use this structure: The passive voice is used when the focus is more on the action rather than the subject performing the action. This is useful when the person performing the action is less important or unknown.

3. Conditional Sentences:
"If the database connection fails, we can send a 500 Database Error message." – This is a first conditional sentence (real and possible situation in the present or future). It’s used to talk about the result of a possible future event.
Why we use this structure: The first conditional is useful for discussing real situations that could happen in the future. It sets up a cause-effect relationship between events.

4. Future Simple Tense: "I'll update the error handling middleware"
"I'll update the error handling middleware" – "I’ll" is a contraction of "I will," and it expresses a future intention or decision.
Why we use this structure: The future simple tense (will) is used to talk about actions that will happen in the future. It shows certainty or intention.


### Conversation 2: Code Review Discussion

Teammate 1:
"I’ve refactored the userController code. It looks cleaner now, but I’m not sure about the naming conventions for some of the functions."

Teammate 2:
"I think getUserDetails is fine, but fetchUserInfo could be renamed to getUserInfo for consistency with other functions."

Teammate 1:
"You're right. I’ll change that. I also added some helper functions to improve readability, but I’m worried it might increase complexity."

Teammate 2:
"Maybe. But if the functions are small and focused on a single task, I think the readability will outweigh the complexity."

Teammate 1:
"Yeah, I agree. I'll make the changes and push the code. Can you review it once I do?"


```Explanation of English Structures in the Conversation:```

1. Present Perfect Tense: "I’ve refactored"
"I’ve refactored the userController code." – The present perfect tense is used to talk about an action that happened at an unspecified time before now. The exact time is not important, but the result is.
Why we use this structure: The present perfect tense is often used when the action is relevant to the present situation. In this case, the refactoring is an important update that is being discussed now.

2. Modal Verbs: "Might" and "Could"
"I’m worried it might increase complexity" – "Might" expresses a possibility in the future, indicating that the teammate is not certain but is considering the potential outcome.
"I think fetchUserInfo could be renamed" – "Could" here is used to express a suggestion or possibility.
Why we use this structure: Using modal verbs like "might" and "could" helps in discussing uncertainty, possibilities, or suggestions. They make the conversation less forceful and more collaborative.

3. Imperative Mood: "Can you review it once I do?"
"Can you review it once I do?" – The imperative mood is used to make a request or give an instruction. In this case, Teammate 1 is politely asking Teammate 2 to review the code after it is pushed.
Why we use this structure: The imperative is often used for giving instructions or making requests. When combined with "please" or "can," it becomes a polite request.

4. Comparative Forms: "the readability will outweigh the complexity"
"I think the readability will outweigh the complexity." – "Outweigh" is a comparative verb that shows one thing is more important or has more value than the other.
Why we use this structure: Comparatives are used to compare two or more things. In technical discussions, comparatives like this can be used to show which approach or solution is preferred over another.

"We can send a 500 Database Error message" – This is in active voice. The subject (we) is doing the action (sending the message).
"Error messages can be structured in a way that’s easier to understand." – If we had used passive here, it would focus more on the action being done to the message rather than who’s doing the action.
Why we use this structure: The passive voice is used when the focus is more on the action rather than the subject performing the action. This is useful when the person performing the action is less important or unknown.

3. Conditional Sentences:
"If the database connection fails, we can send a 500 Database Error message." – This is a first conditional sentence (real and possible situation in the present or future). It’s used to talk about the result of a possible future event.
Why we use this structure: The first conditional is useful for discussing real situations that could happen in the future. It sets up a cause-effect relationship between events.

4. Future Simple Tense: "I'll update the error handling middleware"
"I'll update the error handling middleware" – "I’ll" is a contraction of "I will," and it expresses a future intention or decision.
Why we use this structure: The future simple tense (will) is used to talk about actions that will happen in the future. It shows certainty or intention.

### Conversation 2: Code Review Discussion

Teammate 1:
"I’ve refactored the userController code. It looks cleaner now, but I’m not sure about the naming conventions for some of the functions."

Teammate 2:
"I think getUserDetails is fine, but fetchUserInfo could be renamed to getUserInfo for consistency with other functions."

Teammate 1:
"You're right. I’ll change that. I also added some helper functions to improve readability, but I’m worried it might increase complexity."

Teammate 2:
"Maybe. But if the functions are small and focused on a single task, I think the readability will outweigh the complexity."

Teammate 1:
"Yeah, I agree. I'll make the changes and push the code. Can you review it once I do?"

```Explanation of English Structures in the Conversation:```

1. Present Perfect Tense: "I’ve refactored"
"I’ve refactored the userController code." – The present perfect tense is used to talk about an action that happened at an unspecified time before now. The exact time is not important, but the result is.
Why we use this structure: The present perfect tense is often used when the action is relevant to the present situation. In this case, the refactoring is an important update that is being discussed now.

2. Modal Verbs: "Might" and "Could"
"I’m worried it might increase complexity" – "Might" expresses a possibility in the future, indicating that the teammate is not certain but is considering the potential outcome.
"I think fetchUserInfo could be renamed" – "Could" here is used to express a suggestion or possibility.
Why we use this structure: Using modal verbs like "might" and "could" helps in discussing uncertainty, possibilities, or suggestions. They make the conversation less forceful and more collaborative.

3. Imperative Mood: "Can you review it once I do?"
"Can you review it once I do?" – The imperative mood is used to make a request or give an instruction. In this case, Teammate 1 is politely asking Teammate 2 to review the code after it is pushed.
Why we use this structure: The imperative is often used for giving instructions or making requests. When combined with "please" or "can," it becomes a polite request.

4. Comparative Forms: "the readability will outweigh the complexity"
"I think the readability will outweigh the complexity." – "Outweigh" is a comparative verb that shows one thing is more important or has more value than the other.
Why we use this structure: Comparatives are used to compare two or more things. In technical discussions, comparatives like this can be used to show which approach or solution is preferred over another.

### Conversation 3: Improving Service Scalability

Teammate 1:
"We need to ensure that our service scales well when we add more users. Have you looked into sharding for the database?"

Teammate 2:
"Yes, I have. Sharding could help distribute the load across multiple databases. But we should also consider caching frequently accessed data to reduce database hits."

Teammate 1:
"Right. We could use Redis for caching. I’ll handle that part, but you should work on the database sharding implementation."

Teammate 2:
"Okay, I’ll start setting up the sharding strategy and make sure it’s scalable for future growth. We should also monitor the system’s performance after we deploy the changes."


```Explanation of English Structures in the Conversation:```

1. Future Continuous Tense: "We’ll be adding more users"
"We need to ensure that our service scales well when we add more users." – This is a simple future tense, showing an action that will happen in the future.
Why we use this structure: The future tense is used to discuss actions that will happen later. It is helpful when discussing plans or predictions.

2. Present Simple for General Facts: "Sharding could help distribute the load"
"Sharding could help distribute the load across multiple databases." – This is a factual statement about how sharding works. The present simple tense is used to discuss facts or general truths.
Why we use this structure: The present simple tense is used when stating facts, truths, or general habits. It’s useful in technical discussions to explain how something works.

3. First Conditional: "If we deploy the changes, we will monitor performance"
"We should also monitor the system’s performance after we deploy the changes." – This conditional structure shows what will happen after an action is taken.
Why we use this structure: The first conditional is used to express real or possible conditions in the future. It’s a great way to show the cause-and-effect relationship between two actions.
